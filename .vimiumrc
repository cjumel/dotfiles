# This file contains the custom configuration I set for Vimium.
#
# To use this configuration, go to the Vimium options page (e.g. by pressing `?` in the web
# browser and then clicking on "Options"), paste the content of each section of this file in the
# correspoinding option section and click "Save changes". This must be done in each different
# browser profile.

## Custom key mappings

# Use s/S to search and click a link instead of f/F (like s key in EasyMotion or Hop.nvim)
unmap f
unmap F
map s LinkHints.activateMode
map S LinkHints.activateModeToOpenInNewTab

# Use ,/; to scroll half page up/down
map , scrollPageDown
map ; scrollPageUp

# Disable mappings that don't work well
# J/K follow a kind of most recent tab behavior, see https://github.com/philc/vimium/issues/4230
unmap J
unmap K
# Since I remapped J/K to <C-J>/<C-K> in the browser, let's do the same for H/L
unmap H
unmap L
# x works but tabs closed with it can't be restored with neither regular keymap nor X
unmap x
unmap X
unmap t
