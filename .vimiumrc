# This file contains the custom configuration I set for Vimium, a web browser extension.
# To actually set this configuration, go to the Vimium options page (press `?` in the web
# browser), paste the content of this file in the "Custom key mappings" section, and click "Save".
# This must be done in each different browser profile.

# Switch J & K keys, as in Arc Browser, default order is counter-intuitive
map J nextTab
map K previousTab

# Use s/S to search and click a link instead of f/F (like s key in EasyMotion or Hop.nvim)
unmap f
unmap F
map s LinkHints.activateMode
map S LinkHints.activateModeToOpenInNewTab

# Use ,/; to scroll half page up/down
map , scrollPageDown
map ; scrollPageUp

# Disable mappings that don't work well
# x works but tabs closed with it can't be restored with neither regular keymap nor X
unmap x
unmap X
unmap t
