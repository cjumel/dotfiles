""" Custom key mappings

" I mostly follow the default keymaps, even if I disabled them by default, as I don't use many
" mappings and several default mappings don't work as intented in my web browser
unmapAll

" Default mappings
map ? showHelp
map h scrollLeft
map j scrollDown
map k scrollUp
map l scrollRight
map gg scrollToTop
map G scrollToBottom
map d scrollPageDown
map u scrollPageUp
map r reload

" Custom mappings
" Let's define f & b keymaps like <C-f> & <C-b> in Vim
map f scrollFullPageDown
map b scrollFullPageUp
" Since f is already taken (the default), let's use s/S for links, similarly to s in EasyMotion or
" Hop.nvim
map s LinkHints.activateMode
map S LinkHints.activateModeToOpenInNewTab
" Let's define o & i keymaps like <C-o> & <C-i> in Vim
map o goBack
map i goForward

""" Settings set in the web browser
" In addition to the settings above, some must be done directly in the web browser to work as
" intented
"
" <C-j> & <C-k> are mapped to next & previous tab, respectively (Vimium's nextTab &
" 	previousTab follow a kind of most recent tab behavior I don't want, see
"   	https://github.com/philc/vimium/issues/4230)
" <C-h> & <C-l> are mapped to previous & next profile, respectively
" I use the web browser's <Cmd-t> instead of Vimium's createTab to open a new tab, as when using
"   	the latter, the new tab is blank without even a search bar
" I use the web browser's <Cmd-w> instead of Vimium's removeTab to close a tab, as when using
"   	the latter, the tab can't be re-opened neither with the web browser feature nor with
"   	Vimium's one
