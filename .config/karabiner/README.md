# [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)

Karabiner is a very powerful tool for MacOS to change the behavior of keyboards. It is essential in
my workflow in order to:

- make my non-Apple keyboard behave exactly like an Apple keyboard to make all my keyboards
  consistent with each other
- switch some important keys with less important ones to make the former more accessible
- simplify some key combinations to perform less key strokes or to perform them more easily

Since I'm working a lot within my terminal, I also define some keybindings directly in my terminal
setup, which you can fine [here](/.config/wezterm/).

**Install:**

Karabiner only needs to be installed on my machine, a Macbook.
