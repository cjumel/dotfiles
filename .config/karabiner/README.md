# [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)

Karabiner is a very powerful tool to remap keyboard keys and key-combinations. It is essential in my
workflow in order to:

- make my non-Apple keyboard behave exactly like an Apple keyboard
- switch some important keys and key-combinations with less important ones to make the former more
  accessible (e.g. switching caps-lock and escape is essential for me to use Vim motions)
- affect some key-combinations to other key-combinations with no effect (e.g. `<C-CR>` as no effect
  in the tools I use, so I remapped it to `<C-R>`, a key-combination not that easy to type)

**Install:**

Karabiner only needs to be installed on my machine, a Macbook.
