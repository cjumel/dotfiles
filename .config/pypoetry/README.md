# [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

Poetry is a modern package manager for Python. It has features which makes project management
user-friendly but also make project environments reproducible, with the use of lock files.

**Install:**

Since a Python package managed by Poetry depends on the Poetry version, I install Poetry with
`pipx`, in order to easily manage several versions of Poetry in parallel.
