# [IPython](https://ipython.org/documentation.html)

IPython is an improved Python console, providing many useful features by default, like
auto-completion, or syntax highlighting.

If you don't want to use IPython, you don't have to do anything, simply ingore those files.

**Install:**

IPython can be installed on the global system, however it will work better if it's installed within
the Python environment you wish to use instead.
