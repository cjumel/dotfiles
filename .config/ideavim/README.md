# [IdeaVim](https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim)

Before Neovim, my editor of choice was PyCharm. When starting to have interest in Vim motions, I
used the IdeaVim plugin to enable Vim motions in any JetBrains IDE. It is a great plugin, providing
more great features than just Vim motions (e.g. EasyMotion motions, a NerdTree replica). However I'm
not actively using this plugin anymore, so this configuration might me outdated.

**Install:**

This plugin should be installed directly in PyCharm, along with the
[AceJump](https://github.com/acejump/AceJump) and
[IdeaVim-EasyMotion](https://github.com/AlexPl292/IdeaVim-EasyMotion) plugins to support the
additional features.
