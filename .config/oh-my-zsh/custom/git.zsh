# [[ Reset ]]
# `reset` can be used in 3 forms:
#   - with nothing (target all tracked files/directories),
#   - with a path (target the corresponding tracked files/directories),
#   - or with a commit reference.
# It can also be used with 3 modes:
#   - mixed (unstage & keep the changes),
#   - soft (keep the changes as staged),
#   - or hard (unstage & discard the changes).
# I only use `git reset` to act on commits, as I prefer to use the `git unstage` & `git discard` aliases (they are not actual Git
# keywords) for files and directories

function git_reset_last() {
    git reset --mixed HEAD~"$1"
}
function git_reset_soft_last() {

alias grvs='git revert --skip'     # Revert skip: skip a commit during a revert in progress

# [[ Stage ]]
# I prefer `git stage` over `git add` for several reasons:
#   - in Gitsigns & Neogit I use "stage" as well, so this is consistent with that ("a", like "add", cannot be used properly with Gitsigns
#       in visual mode with Hydra, due to conflicts with "arround" text-objects)
#   - it's the proper term for staging changes in Git
#   - it goes well with the "unstage" alias I define below & which is used in Gitsigns & Neogit

alias gs='git stage'           # Stage: add the targeted files' changes to the staging area
alias gsu='git stage --update' # Stage update: add the tracked files' changes to the staging area

# [[ Tag ]]

alias gt='git tag'           # Tag: create a local tag
alias gtd='git tag --delete' # Tag delete: delete a local tag

# [[ Unstage ]]
# `git unstage` is not an actual command, but I introduced it for several reasons:
#  - in Gitsigns & Neogit I use "unstage" as well, so this is consistent with that
#  - since theere is a "git stage" command, it makes sense to have a corresponding "git unstage" alias
#  - it reduces the burden on the "gr" aliases, as alternatives would involve "git restore" or "git reset"

alias gu='git restore --staged'     # Unstage: remove from the staging area the targeted files' changes
alias gua='git restore --staged :/' # Unstage all: remove from the staging area all the changes

# [[ Worktree ]]

alias gwl='git worktree list'   # Worktree list: list all existing worktrees
alias gwr='git worktree remove' # Worktree remove: delete a worktree

# [[ Discard ]]
# `git discard` is not an actual command, but I introduced it for several reasons:
#   - in Gitsigns & Neogit I use "x" for discard as well, so this is consistent with that
#   - it's in my opinion the proper term for discarding changes in Git
#   - it reduces the burden on the "gr" & "gc" aliases, as alternatives would involve "git restore" or "git clean"

alias gx='git restore'       # Discard: throw away the unstaged changes of the targeted tracked files
alias gxa='git restore :/'   # Discard all: throw away all unstaged changes in tracked files
alias gxu='git clean -dn'    # Discard untracked: dry-run to discard untracked, not ignored files

alias gxui='git clean -di'   # Discard intracked interactive: interactively discard untracked, not ignored files
alias gxua='git clean -dxn'  # Discard untracked all: dry-run to discard all untracked files
alias gxuaf='git clean -dxf' # Discard untracked all force: actually discard all untracked files
alias gxuai='git clean -dxi' # Discard untracked all interactive: interactively discard all untracked files

# [[ Stash ]]
# I use `gz` as prefix for `git stash` aliases to avoid any conflict with `git stage` which I use a lot & because this is consistent
# with Neogit

alias gz='git stash'                      # Stash: move local changes in tracked files to the stash
