# [Starship](https://starship.rs/)

I use Starship as an improved terminal prompt. It brings many additional features compared to
Oh-my-zsh's one, along with an improved look and without any sacrifice in performance, being written
in Rust. It is comparable to [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k), which I used
to use before, but it is faster and a lot easier to configure.

**Install:**
