# [Eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza)

I use `eza` as a drop-in replacement of the builtin `ls`.

**Install:**

I usually only install `eza` on my machine, a MacOS.

<details>
<summary>MacOS</summary>

```shell
brew install eza
```

</details>

**Disable:**

To disable `eza` setup, simply delete the `.config/eza/eza.zsh` file. If you've run the `make`
command already, also remove the `~/.config/eza/eza.zsh` symlink which should have been created.
