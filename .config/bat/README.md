# [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)

I use `bat` as a drop-in replacement of the builtin `cat`.

**Install:**

I usually only install `bat` on my machine, a MacOS.

<details>
<summary>MacOS</summary>

```shell
brew install bat
```

</details>

**Disable:**

To disable `bat` setup, simply delete the `.config/bat/bat.zsh` file. If you've run the `make`
command already, also remove the `~/.config/bat/bat.zsh` symlink which should have been created.
