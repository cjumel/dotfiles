# [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html)

I use Wezterm as my terminal emulator. I first used the MacOS terminal application, but it lacked
some display features. I then switched to Iterm2, but it still lacked some features and was not easy
to configure. I finally switched to WezTerm, which has at the same time more features (e.g. window
with no title bar but resizable), is easier to setup (e.g. popular background colors are bundled in
it), is very performant (being written in Rust) and can be configured via Lua code, the same
language as Neovim's configuration.

**Install:**

WezTerm only needs to be installed on my machine, a Macbook.
