# [Tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr)

`tldr` is a collaborative tool providing a user-friendly & synthetic documentation to many commands.
It is designed to be complementary to the `man` pages & can replace it in many cases as long as the
desired information is not too niche, but it doesn't aim at replacing it entirely.

## Install

<details>
<summary>MacOS</summary>

The `tldr` formula does exist on Homebrew, but the recommanded one is `tlrc`, the official Rust
client for `tldr`.

```shell
brew install tlrc
```
