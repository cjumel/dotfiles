# [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr)

`tldr` is a collaborative tool providing a user-friendly and synthetic documentation to many
terminal tool commands. It is designed to be complementary to the `man` pages and can replace it in
many cases as long as the desired information is not too "niche", but it doesn't aim at replacing it
entirely. It is very simple to use and comes with great defaults.

**Install:**

The `tldr` formula does exist on Homebrew for MacOS, but the recommanded one is `tlrc`, the official
Rust client for `tldr`.

```bash
brew install tlrc
```
