# [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)

`fd` is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to `find`.

I don't use `fd` directly, but it's integrated with other tools I use, like the Neovim plugin
`telescope.nvim` or as a search source for `fzf`.

**Install:**

<details>
<summary>MacOS</summary>

```shell
brew install fd
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>Linux</summary>

```shell
apt install fd-find
```
