# [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex
pattern.

I don't use ripgrep directly, but it's integrated with other tools I use, like the Neovim plugin
`telescope.nvim`.

**Install:**

<summary>MacOS</summary>

```shell
brew install ripgrep
```

<details>
<summary>Linux</summary>

```shell
apt-get install ripgrep
